## This visualization is inspired by my dream one night:

On a seemingly ordinary night, I gaze up at the starry sky. A full moon casts its glow, but there is something unsettling about it: The moon shines in a golden hue, more prominent than usual, and its size looms larger than ever before. As I fixate on the moon's mesmerizing presence, I notice something extraordinary—it is in motion. This revelation strikes me as odd, for I have always known the moon to be relatively stationary, slowly traversing its orbit around the Earth. However, tonight, its movement seems perceptible, almost as if time itself has quickened.

Perhaps my eyes have become keener, enabling me to discern the moon's gradual traversal with greater acuity. That must be it, I reason, dismissing any lingering doubts. Moments lapsed, and I turned my gaze skyward once more, only to be greeted by an astonishing sight—the moon's ethereal glow teetering upon the horizon. This occurrence usually foreshadows the impending break of dawn, yet the inky blackness of the night prevails, and only half an hour has elapsed since the moon's westward shift.

Unease settles within me. My gaze remains fixed upon the midnight sky, only to witness the moon entirely disappear from its celestial abode, vanishing beyond the western horizon. Moments later, however, it resurfaces from the east, now more enormous and swifter in its movement, swiping across the sky. The cycle repeats: with each disappearance in the West, it emerges larger in the East, with a swifter pace than before. An alarming realization dawns upon me: something inexplicably anomalous is unfolding before my eyes.

A theory takes root in my mind—a realization founded on the principles of celestial mechanics. As the moon orbits the Earth, its distance from Earth determines its apparent size and the speed at which it circulates our planet. If this distance were to decline, it follows that the moon would appear larger and move faster, propelled by gravitational acceleration. The inescapable conclusion is clear—the moon is crashing toward Earth, an imminent catastrophe known as the "Moonfall."

Word spreads swiftly, and a crowd forms, all drawn to this surreal spectacle. Beauty entwines with dread as the moon, now a colossal presence, zips across the sky, disappearing and reappearing with alarming velocity. Momentum builds relentlessly, and then, in a fierce burst of blinding radiance, all is consumed by a golden blaze. The world dissolves into oblivion, marking the final chapter of our Earth's existence.

Everything fades into nothingness, and all that appears before my eyes are streaks of shooting stars.
